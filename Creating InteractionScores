### Sript for Calculating an 'Interaction Score', a statistical measure of the percentage of a specific metric from social media data against the whole corpus and represents this as a decimal.
# The below uses Youtube data and views as the metric for interactions, but is adaptable for other datasets such as totals for Facebook Reacts (Like, Love, Anger, etc.) or X Likes.
# Assuming the data.frame containing data is called "Youtube", formatted with data from Youtube Data API V3 (Available here: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)

# Calculate total interaction metrics
Total_views <- sum(Youtube$viewCount, na.rm = TRUE)

# Calculate InteractionScore for each row
Youtube <- Youtube %>%
  mutate(InteractionScore = (viewCount / Total_views))

Youtubejson <- toJSON(Youtube, pretty = TRUE)

# Save the JSON data to a file
write(Youtubejson, file = "Youtube.json")
