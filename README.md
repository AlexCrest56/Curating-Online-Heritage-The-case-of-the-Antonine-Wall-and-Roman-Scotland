User_Specified_LDA is a program for creatin LDA topic models across different social media data, and then visualising these topics with LDAvis. It also adds topic labels and propobilities to documents. It is built to interact with a mongodb database.

There is also a program to sample LDA derived topics using cochrane's formula.

The scrips run in python 3.8

In the future I will add step-by-step instructions on how to set up a google collab page, link this to a google drive and run the scripts from there.
